You will be presented with a triangle or square pattern appearing on the left or the right side of the screen. You will see two avatars who will turn to look at some of these patterns. Your task is to <b>look at the </b><b>$target$</b> <b>pattern by turning your head towards it</b>.
At least one of the avatars will turn to look at the $target$ pattern as well. When the pattern disappears, please return your head to the middle and look at the middle of the screen again.
However, <b>you should not look at the </b><b>$nontarget$ </b><b>pattern</b>! Please avoid turning your head towards the $nontarget$ pattern even if one of the avatars might be looking at it.
Finally, there will sometimes be an extra challenge: Both avatars will be wearing sunglasses, and these sunglasses may suddenly flash with a blue color. When the sunglasses on one of the avatars flash blue, press the “spacebar” as fast as you can. When this happens, <b>do not turn</b> your head towards any of the patterns appearing to the left or right.
