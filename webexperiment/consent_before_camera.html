<p><b>For this experiment to work correctly you will need to give access to your webcam on the next screen. </b></p>
<p align ="justify">Please be aware that anything that is picked up by your camera during the experiment will be uploaded in the video at the end of the experiment. This means we will be recording privacy sensitive information, namely your face, and anything else that is picked by the camera. To ensure privacy, we therefore would like to ask that you to make sure that no other persons except you as participant enter the view of the camera. Also, please see to it that no privacy sensitive information is recorded by your webcam (for instance on the wall behind you). Please confirm you can meet these conditions before you proceed. At the end of the experiment, video data are uploaded and stored in an encoded format. They will be anonymized (made unrecognizable) after analysis and before they are shared with anyone outside of our lab.
