<h1>Brief Description of Experiment</h1>
<p  align='justify'>In our experiment you will be presented with patterns appearing on the left or the right side of the screen. Your task is to look at one of these patterns by turning your head towards it. Additionally, you will see two avatars who will sometimes turn to look at the patterns. More detailed instructions regarding the experiment will be presented later.</p>
<h2>Informed Consent</h2>
<p  align='justify'>I have been satisfactorily informed about the procedure and aims of the study. I have additionally been informed about the anonymization procedures regarding the privacy sensitive video and screen recording data that will be gathered. I have read and understood that the screen, video and demographic data is stored together with a Prolific ID that cannot be linked back to me. I am aware that I have the right to revoke this declaration at any later date without any disadvantages.</p>
<p  align='justify'>Any questions I had about the procedure were answered satisfactorily by the investigators. I hereby declare myself ready to participate in the voluntary study documented as part of the "Spot the patterns" study.</p>

<p  align='justify'>I understand that the screen and visual data will be stored in an electronic database at the Bremen University in an encrypted way. I am aware that the privacy sensitive screen and video data that are collected include my face and my background, and that those data will be deleted at the latest on 31.09.2024, and that until that time they will be stored in an encrypted format. I am also aware that data regarding questionnaires and demographics will be stored in an anonymized way. Furthermore, I understand that data collected from me, is digitally stored, processed and analyzed and used for scientific publication, in a way that makes it impossible to trace the data back to me personally. These data include: screen, video, questionnaires and demographic data.</p>
<h2>Declaration of Consent for Data Collection </h2>
<p  align='justify'>I was able to ask all the questions that seemed relevant to me about possible risks and complications that may be caused by the study and necessary preparations for the study. I understood the information and measures I received.
I hereby declare myself ready to participate in the voluntary study described in the information letter as part of the above-mentioned scientific study and give my consent that video and screen data will be recorded.
</p>
<h2>Declaration of Consent for Data Protection</h2>
<p  align='justify'> I agree that the data collected in the course of this study will be recorded on electronic data carriers. Please note, that we do not immediately anonymize your screen and visual data in this study such that it is rendered unrecognizable. We first need these non-anonymized data to perform our analyses. Your recognizable data will be stored temporarily under strict security measures. They will be encrypted, and access is restricted to employees involved in the project. This is ensured by usage of up-to-date encryption techniques and passwords. The non-anonymized data will then be processed and statistically analyzed, whereafter they will be anonymized (making all screen and visual information unrecognizable). Your non-anonymized data will be deleted at the latest on 31.09.2024.</p>
<p  align='justify'>My participation in this study is voluntary. I can revoke my participation at any time during the experiment, even without giving reasons. This does not give me any disadvantages except for remuneration of participation. In this case, the data collected in the session will be deleted irrevocably.
<br>I know that my data can be deleted only after sending my Prolific ID
<b><br>I hereby agree to all the terms and conditions mentioned above by moving forward in this experiment
