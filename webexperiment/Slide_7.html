<h2 style="text-align: justify;">There will now be a small warm-up task before we begin with the main study. This task is intended to help you feel more comfortable and relaxed. It should simply be fun.</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">You will see a short video of another person on the next screen. This person will show a facial expression. Your task is to try to make an expression that looks as similar as possible to the one shown by this person.&nbsp; Please do not worry about making any &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; on this task. Just try your best to make your own expression look like what the other person is showing.</h2>
