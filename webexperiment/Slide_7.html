<p>We will now present a short warm-up task before we begin with the main study. This task is intended to help you feel more comfortable and relaxed. It should simply be fun.</p><p>You will see a short video of another person on the next screen. This person will show a facial expression. Your task is to try to make an expression that looks as similar as possible to the one shown by this person.  Please do not worry about making any “mistakes” on this task. Just try your best to make your own expression look like what the other person is showing.</p>
